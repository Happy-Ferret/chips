# [chips]

A plugin manager for [fish].

## Why another plugin manager? Why not Oh My Fish?

OMF is lovely, but it does have its shortcomings. chips aims to address them. The advantages are:

- Fast: **Parallel installation/upgrade** of plugins.
- Minimally invasive to your `config.fish`: Adding **one** line is sufficient
- Zero overhead to the fish shell itself: **Only plugins will be sourced**, chips itself doesn't require any fish script to be loaded at all to work
- **Zero dependency** and minimum installation cost: chips is a single statically-compiled binary executable file

[Not an April Fools' joke](https://github.com/kinoru/chips/commit/0b87850ab0a658391b643f0ecc37f748dac89010).

## Installation

Download **chips 1.0.0** (2016-04-01):

- [chips 1.0.0 for GNU/Linux (x64)]
- [chips 1.0.0 for OS X]

Then put it in a directory that is in `$PATH`. Normally the recommended location is `~/.local/bin`.

### Installation the hard way: Build from source

Use [Stack].

```fish
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/kinoru/chips
cd chips
stack install
```

## Usage

1. Run `chips`. This will create `~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml` with the default template.
1. Edit `plugin.yaml` to include your desired plugins. For example, consider [fish-sensible] or [shellder].
1. Run `chips` again.

Any time you make changes to `plugin.yaml` or you want to update plugins, run `chips` again.

## Supported features

- Sourcing `init.fish` of plugins
- Installing themes: Plugins that contain `fish_prompt.fish` or `fish_right_prompt.fish`

## Coming soon

- Completely purging unused plugins
- Files under `functions` and `completions`
